Ahh okay ‚úÖ that means your program files (.exe) have also been associated with Windows Photo Viewer.
That‚Äôs why Chrome (and probably all apps) are trying to ‚Äúopen as pictures.‚Äù

This is a known issue in Windows 7 ‚Äî the .exe file association is broken.
We need to restore the correct registry settings for .exe files.

üîß Fix: Restore .exe file association

Option 1 ‚Äì Ready-made .reg file (easiest)

1. Open Notepad.


2. Copy-paste the text below:



Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.exe]
@="exefile"
"Content Type"="application/x-msdownload"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile]
@="Application"
"EditFlags"=hex:38,07,00,00
"FriendlyTypeName"="@shell32.dll,-10150"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shell]
@="open"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shell\open\command]
@="\"%1\" %*"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shell\runas]
@="Run as &administrator"
"HasLUAShield"=""

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shell\runas\command]
@="\"%1\" %*"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shellex]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shellex\DropHandler]
@="{86C86720-42A0-1069-A2E8-08002B30309D}"

3. Save it as fix_exe.reg

In Notepad ‚ÄúSave as type‚Äù ‚Üí select All Files, not .txt.



4. Double-click the file ‚Üí click Yes to add it to the registry.


5. Restart your PC.



Now .exe files (like Chrome, Word, VLC) should open correctly again. üéâ

Option 2 ‚Äì If you cannot open Notepad

If even Notepad doesn‚Äôt open because everything launches in Photo Viewer:

Restart your PC in Safe Mode with Command Prompt.

Then type:

assoc .exe=exefile
ftype exefile="%1" %*

Press Enter.


This will restore .exe defaults.

üëâ Do you want me to prepare a ready-to-use .reg file for you, so you can just download and run it instead of copying text manually?
